        <p>As a dental receptionist and general worker, I have honed a versatile skill set tailored to the demands of both administrative and hands-on roles within a dental practice. My experience includes efficiently managing patient inquiries, appointments, and records with meticulous attention to detail and a friendly demeanor. I excel in creating a welcoming atmosphere for patients, ensuring their comfort from the moment they enter the practice. Additionally, I have actively contributed to the smooth operation of the office by assisting with various administrative tasks, such as billing, insurance claims processing, and inventory management. On the clinical side, I have assisted dentists and hygienists chairside, demonstrating proficiency in sterilization procedures, instrument handling, and patient care. My adaptability and dedication make me an asset in both front and back-office settings, where I strive to uphold the highest standards of professionalism and patient satisfaction.</p>
